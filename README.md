Answer from Perplexity: pplx.ai/shareThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.


Recommended Git Workflow for Your Project
1. Use Feature Branches
Create a new branch for each feature or fix:

bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
This keeps your main branch clean and stable.

2. Commit Often with Clear Messages
Make small, focused commits.

Use descriptive messages explaining why you made changes:

bash
git commit -m "Fix form validation on login page"
This helps track changes and eases code review.

3. Keep Branches Up-to-Date
Regularly sync your feature branch with main to avoid conflicts:

bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
Rebasing keeps history linear and clean.

4. Use Pull Requests (PRs) Even Solo
Use PRs to merge feature branches into main.

This encourages reviewing your own changes and maintaining quality.

You can also use PRs to trigger automated tests or deployments if set up.

5. Clean Up Merged Branches
After merging, delete feature branches locally and remotely:

bash
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
Keeps your repo tidy and manageable.

Additional Tips
Consider GitHub Flow if you want a simple, continuous delivery-friendly workflow: branch off main, open PRs, merge after review, deploy immediately.

For more complex release cycles, GitFlow or OneFlow workflows can be used, but they add overhead.

Always use SSH keys or personal access tokens for secure authentication, as you‚Äôve set up.
